# litemount

## what is this?
This is a mounting unit for the LiteBeam series from Ubnt. Only tested with LiteBeam M5. Idea is to use a commercially available suction cup base and print a little arm with 2 additional degrees of freedom.

## general stuff
 - all holes are for M5 screws
 - use washers, if you have the big ones with 15mm outer diameter (e.g. DIN 9021)

## important print settings
 - lots of infill (80% is okay)
 - have a look at the layers before you print, you might have to activate support

### slic3r printing
 - activate support
 - activate "don't support bridges"
 - pattern: pillars
This should build a support only under the screw hole in the middle of the part.

## where do I get the suction cup base?
In china:
